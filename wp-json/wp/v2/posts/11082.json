You&#8217;ve come to the right place! This article provides valuable information on the most cost-effective housing options available for international students in Canada.<\/p>\n<p>As an international student, there are numerous housing choices to consider in Canada. Whether you prefer on-campus residences or off-campus apartments for rent, this comprehensive article offers insights tailored to your needs.<\/p>\n<p>Securing suitable accommodation in Canada can be quite daunting, especially for international students. We recognize the challenges you may face, and to simplify your search, we have carefully curated a list of the most affordable accommodation options for international students in Canada in 2023.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Types of Cheap Accommodation<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>In Canada<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There are different housing options if you want to study in Canada. They can be on-campus or off-campus, temporary or permanent, and even shared or private apartments.<\/p>\n<p>Most Canadian schools offer assistance to international students in finding suitable housing options.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the types of student accommodations you can find in Canada;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Dormitories<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Dormitories are large on-campus<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>houses usually built in the form of hostels; some school dormitories can accommodate up to 30000 students per academic year. Each student is assigned to a dorm\/room they share with other 4-5 students of the same gender. Students also share facilities like kitchens, bathrooms, and study areas.<\/p>\n<p>This type of accommodation is recommended mainly for first-year students because of its proximity to the main campus.<\/p>\n<p>Dormitories are affordable and allow students to make friendly connections early in their study.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Average cost<\/strong>: 250 &#8211; 600 CAD per month<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Townhouses<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This is another residence usually reserved for upper-year students who wish to live on campus. Although not as large as dormitories, they usually contain about three to six bedrooms and can accommodate up to 10 students at a time.<\/p>\n<p>Townhouses offer more privacy with single occupancy rooms, which you do not have to share with a roommate. You also get access to a personal kitchen area or cafeteria where you can purchase regular meals, a bathroom, and utilities such as Internet at an affordable price.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Average cost:\u00a0<\/strong>250 &#8211; 650 CAD per month.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Private Rentals<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>These types of apartments are suitable for students who have a higher budget. The cost of private rentals can be pretty high; you can find other students looking for similar accommodation and share the cost.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Average cost: 1200 &#8211; 2500CAD<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Shared Apartments<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Shared Apartments are usually off-campus residences where you can get single rooms in an apartment shared with other students. Like townhouses, they offer single rooms with shared kitchens, study rooms, and living rooms.<\/p>\n<p>They can be very expensive in big cities like Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal. It is the second-best option for students who do not want to live on campus. You shouldn&#8217;t depend too much on your university for assistance with this type of accommodation. However, the schools may refer you to trustworthy agencies providing the necessary housing services.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Average cost: 400 &#8211; 800CAD<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Homestay<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Homestays allow international students to live with Canadian families during their studies. Staying in a host family provides a furnished private room, 24\/7 internet access, and 1-3 meals daily. You also learn more about Canadian culture and interact with families from different ethnicities.<\/p>\n<p>In most host housing, the family cleans and cooks, so you get more time to focus on your studies and enjoy an active social life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Average Cost: 375 &#8211; 800CAD<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Sublets<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>A sublet is an apartment rented by a single person or student whose name is on the lease, temporarily renting out spaces\/rooms in the same apartment to other students at a reduced fee.<\/p>\n<p>It is an affordable option for students with a tight budget. The lease is valid for the academic year before passing it to another student or individual. This unique arrangement only works if the landlord has an agreement with the students.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Average cost: $900 &#8211; $1500<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Factors To Consider When Choosing Cheap Accommodation In Canada<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There are certain things to look out for when searching for the perfect accommodation for international students in Canada. They include;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Utilities<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There are some utilities that an ideal student apartment must have. Before you rent an apartment, inquire about the utilities provided during your stay.<\/p>\n<p>Utilities like hot water, meal plans, Internet, and television should allow you to live comfortably and focus fully on your academics. You must inform your accommodation provider before completing your rent if you have any special needs or requirements.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Distance to school\/campus<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Distance and Location are other factors to consider when searching for off-campus accommodation. A quick trip from your apartment to school should not be more than an hour.<\/p>\n<p>Long drives or trips to campus can affect your schedule and study time. You should be able to easily trek, drive, or take a bus to school.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Type of Housing<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In Canada, there are a range of student housing options. It&#8217;s up to you to choose the accommodation that best suits your lifestyle. If you enjoy privacy, you&#8217;ll be less likely to be comfortable in a school dormitory. A shared apartment will be a better option.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Budget<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The accommodation cost in Canada for international students is the first thing to consider before you begin your search. You should know how much you can afford to purchase your desired apartment.<\/p>\n<p>The average cost of an off-campus apartment ranges between 500 CAD &#8211; 2100 CAD per month. This price depends on the location and type of accommodation.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Safety and Securities<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Always put your safety first, and do adequate research about an area before signing a lease. You can also check reviews, and if you know any students who have lived in the same area, reach out to them.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Cheap Accommodation In Canada for International Students<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As an international student in Canada, it&#8217;s not every house you stay in that will give you the comfort you desire. But, by making the right choices and having a detailed list like the one we&#8217;ve given you below, you can find the ideal apartment.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Casita Student Residences<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Casita is a student accommodation platform that assists international students worldwide in finding suitable student apartments.
