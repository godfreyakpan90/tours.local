Those who commit cyber attack are otherwise called Cybercriminals. Cyber attacks are typically carried out by individuals or groups known as hackers, who exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems or exploit human weaknesses to carry out their malicious activities.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_Does_Cyber_Attack_Works\" class=\"ez-toc-section\"><\/span>How Does Cyber Attack Works<\/h2>\n<p>To explain this, lets use a typical Cyber Attack example of a cyber attack called phishing attack. Here\u2019s how it typically unfolds:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The attacker sends an email to a target individual, pretending to be a trusted entity such as a bank, a popular online service, or a reputable organization.<\/li>\n<li>The email is carefully crafted to appear legitimate, often including official logos, language, and a sense of urgency or importance.<\/li>\n<li>The email may contain a link that directs the target to a fake website that looks identical to the legitimate one. Alternatively, it may contain a malicious attachment.<\/li>\n<li>The target, believing the email to be genuine, clicks on the link or downloads the attachment.<\/li>\n<li>If the target visits the fake website, they are prompted to enter their login credentials, personal information, or credit card details, which are then captured by the attacker.<\/li>\n<li>If the target opens the malicious attachment, it may install malware on their computer, granting the attacker unauthorized access to their system.<\/li>\n<li>With the stolen credentials or the compromised system, the attacker can carry out further malicious activities, such as unauthorized financial transactions, identity theft, or spreading malware to other devices on the network.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Phishing attacks are a common and effective method used by cybercriminals to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. It is crucial to be cautious when interacting with emails, especially those requesting personal information or urging immediate action. Verifying the authenticity of emails, avoiding clicking on suspicious links, and regularly updating security software can help protect against phishing attacks.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Types_of_Cyber_Attack\" class=\"ez-toc-section\"><\/span><strong>Different Cyber Attack Type<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There are various cyber attack type, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Malware Attacks:<\/strong>\u00a0These involve the use of malicious software (malware) such as viruses, worms, ransomware, or spyware to gain unauthorized access or cause harm to computer systems or networks.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Phishing Attacks:<\/strong>\u00a0Phishing involves sending deceptive emails or messages that appear legitimate to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, or login credentials.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:<\/strong>\u00a0In a DoS attack, the attacker floods a target system or network with excessive traffic or requests, causing it to become overwhelmed and unavailable to legitimate users.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:<\/strong>\u00a0In a MitM attack, an attacker intercepts and alters communications between two parties without their knowledge, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Social Engineering Attacks:<\/strong>\u00a0These attacks manipulate human behavior and exploit trust to deceive individuals into revealing confidential information or performing certain actions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Password Attacks<\/strong>: Password attacks involve attempting to crack or guess passwords through techniques like brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, or password spraying.<\/li>\n<li><strong>SQL Injection Attacks:<\/strong>\u00a0In an SQL injection attack, an attacker injects malicious code into a website or application\u2019s database query, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the database or manipulating its contents.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span id=\"How_to_Prevent_Cyber_Attack_and_Stay_Safe\" class=\"ez-toc-section\"><\/span>How to Prevent Cyber Attack and Stay Safe<\/h2>\n<p>It is important to take precautionary measure to stay ahead of any form of Cyber Security attack. Prevention tips to cyber attack includes but not limited to the following.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use strong and unique passwords.<\/li>\n<li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA).<\/li>\n<li>Keep software and devices updated.<\/li>\n<li>Use a firewall.<\/li>\n<li>Install reputable antivirus and anti-malware software.<\/li>\n<li>Exercise caution with emails, attachments, and links.<\/li>\n<li>Practice safe web browsing.<\/li>\n<li>Regularly backup your data.<\/li>\n<li>Be mindful of social engineering tactics.<\/li>\n<li>Educate yourself on cybersecurity best practices.<\/li>\n<li>Secure your home network.<\/li>\n<li>Monitor your financial and online accounts for suspicious activity.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Among this, other security measures may include online users being conscious that any website visited is attack itself.
