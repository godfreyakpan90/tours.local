Activities like brisk walking, swimming, cycling, or dancing can help improve cardiovascular health and lower blood pressure.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Follow a Healthy Diet<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Adopt the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products. Limit your intake of sodium, saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol. Incorporate potassium-rich foods like bananas, oranges, spinach, and sweet potatoes.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Reduce Sodium Intake<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Limit your sodium consumption by avoiding processed and packaged foods, as they tend to be high in sodium. Read food labels and opt for low-sodium alternatives. Instead, flavor your meals with herbs, spices, and natural seasonings.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Maintain a Healthy Weight<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Losing excess weight can significantly lower blood pressure. Adopt a balanced diet and engage in regular physical activity to achieve and maintain a healthy weight range.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Limit Alcohol Consumption<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Excessive alcohol intake can raise blood pressure.

They are rich in essential nutrients, fiber, and antioxidants. Aim for around 4-5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Whole grains:<\/strong> Opt for whole grains instead of refined grains. Whole grains like whole wheat, brown rice, oats, quinoa, and whole grain breads provide more fiber and nutrients. Aim for 6-8 servings of whole grains per day.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lean proteins:<\/strong> Choose lean sources of protein such as skinless poultry, fish, legumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas), and tofu. Limit red meat intake and opt for lean cuts when consumed. Aim for 2-3 servings of lean protein per day.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Low-fat dairy products:<\/strong> Include low-fat or fat-free dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese. These are sources of calcium and other essential nutrients.
