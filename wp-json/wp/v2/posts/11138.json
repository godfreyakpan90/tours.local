This functionality closely resembles what Twitter used to provide before it underwent changes under the ownership and leadership of Elon Musk. These changes have been criticized for aggressively encouraging users to subscribe to the paid Twitter Blue service.<\/p>\n<p>Developed by the Instagram team and integrated with users&#8217; Instagram accounts, Threads permits posts with a maximum length of 500 characters. These posts can include various media elements such as links, photos, GIFs, and videos with a duration of up to five minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, Threads is accessible for download on iOS and Android devices in more than 100 countries. Within its initial seven hours, an astonishing estimated 10 million individuals purportedly registered for the service. If you wish to join this user base, here are the steps to Threads sign up.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Note: <\/strong><\/em><br \/>\n<em><strong>if you Sign up for Threads account and subsequently decide to delete it, Meta will also delete your associated Instagram account.
